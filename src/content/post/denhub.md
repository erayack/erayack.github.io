## Abstract

Datahubs step forth as convenient test beds for innovative solutions to create value from the energy data. There are numerous pilots and early trials for establishing energy Datahubs, especially in northern Europe. These are all centralised models, and the centralisation of data control and value creation can be regarded as contradictory to the decentralisation trend in the energy sector. This paper attempts to design the first decentralised energy Datahub ecosystemâ€™s business ecosystem, with the name DenHub, using Blockchain technology. This model enables easy access to transparent and flexible energy data and new business models that will emerge upon its use. All data produced, distributed, used, and curated will help researchers and entrepreneurs study this field and propose new business models to make the energy ecosystem more efficient, clean, and inclusive. The paper also presents the differences between centralised and decentralised methods by underlining the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.
